When I was in elementary school, I can vividly recall the countless hours I spent sketching and drawing anything and everything that my imagination conjured. With 2 shades of graphite pencils in my pocket and a cheap Walmart sketchbook, I visually documented the transient sparks of my childhood mind everywhere I went. From sketching neat architecture and drawing fantastic creatures to drafting design plans of cars powered by photosynthesis, sketchbooks were the ideal medium to translate the beautiful insanity of my thoughts as a young kid.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the middle school years, computers no longer used dial-up connections and graphics software was no longer limited to the capabilities of Microsoft Paint. As computers grew more advanced, I had adopted a new passion for digital technology and the creative opportunities it presented. Translating ideas into sketchbooks became less frequent when I bought myself a Wacom drawing tablet, and the once-static figures were fleshed into life when I taught myself Flash Professional. Middle school was also the age that I was first exposed to code development, all thanks to Whirled. In this online virtual world, I learned that writings several lines of code added immense interactivity to the animated characters I built on Flash, and this sentiment itself of infinite possibilities has been one of the driving influences of why I study computer programming to this day.</p>
<p>In retrospect, my creative passion has been perpetually been shaped by the ever-evolving digital landscape. Traditional practices of done over pencil and paper have been overtaken by the convenience of software applications, presentations are no longer limited to Bristol board displays, and online communication has never been so integrated into our daily lives as it was 10 years ago.
With these shifts to a tech-oriented culture, I have grown to appreciate and cultivate interests that have emerged from the digital uprising; new disciplines such as user interface design and front-end development have surfaced into my view as intriguing career prospects that aligns both my interests in tech and design. The opportunity to create digital experiences that prompts inspiration and creativity in people is a career I have currently aspired to, and I want to be the someone who develops software that makes makes people just as excited as I was when I was discovered Microsoft Paint when I was 6 (except with a more intuitive, modern GUI, of course). And with every new technology I learn, the possibilities to create software become even more prospective.</p>
<p>But under my technical specifications of software languages, independent side projects and university courses that constitute my professional persona lies more genuine and natural attribute to my identity: an undying willingness to create and design, and an evolved passion that ignited from a pair of graphic pencils and a cheap sketchbook.</p>
