Given the obsessive state of today&#39;s social media, Instagram users have become more critical of their post statistics, where upload times are even precisely calculated in order to optimize the most likes. This semi-egotistical notion of counting likes along with the incentive to learn some web dev was the drive to create #instakarma, a front-end web applcation that does (nearly) just that.</p>
<h5 id="-design-"><strong>Design</strong></h5>
<p>With a singular purpose to count an Instagram&#39;s user in mind, the design of the application was evaluated through a minimalist approach. The web app mainly focused the user&#39;s attention to their tally count, while enabling them with an action to recount their likes. Overloading the visual interface with additional functionality would have retracted from the application&#39;s main purpose.</p>
<p>Personalization was achieved by pulling visual media from Instagram&#39;s API and covering the app&#39;s background with the user&#39;s images. Visual and color cues from Instagram&#39;s mobile application were borrowed to evoke familiarity to existing users. For example, Instagram&#39;s notification &#39;chat bubble&#39; was recycled as the tally count component, and the blue buttons from the mobile app&#39;s home row reinforced the interactivity of the recount button. Reusing Instagram&#39;s design influences along with adding a visual layer of personalization results in a familiar, intuitive experience for the user. </p>

<p><em>Each screen display feels personal for each user through the familiarity of their own images.</em></p>
<p>Cross-device responsiveness was also a key design decision for the application. Designing for two breakpoints&mdash;mobile and desktop&mdash;enables the user to interact with the app through a greater array of devices. Limiting the application solely as a desktop web app would comprimise its accessibility, and the app&#39;s especially shareable nature would be diminished. </p>

<p><em>#instakarma is responsive for both mobile and desktop screens.</em></p>
<h5 id="-development-"><strong>Development</strong></h5>
<p>#instakarma was also a fun exercise of developing a web application from start to completion. Entirely existing as a front-end application, I was able to focus on writing the client-side functionality of the app without worrying about any technical intricacies in the backend. </p>
<p>With regards to the UI implementation, responsive design was achieved through writing custom CSS media queries. SASS was used in writing the stylesheets to benefit from selector nesting and variables.</p>
<p>jQuery was the primary Javascript library for the web app as it provides convenience with AJAX and event handling for the developer. The application relies on communicating with Instagram&#39;s API in order to retrieve user data, and jQuery was instrumental to the implementation as it enabled me to handle HTTP request/responses with greater convenience. Less lines of code are written when leveraging jQuery&#39;s AJAX library methods in comparison to a standard Javascript implementation. Event handling was also optimized for the developer as the jQuery library includes abbreviated methods that make it easy for the developer to implement.</p>
<p>The application needed to frequently interact Instagram&#39;s API, making #instakarma one of my first web projects with sufficient AJAX programming. Writing the app enabled me to learn how to aunthenticate a user through their API token method and request the user&#39;s specific media assets. The original intention of the app was to tally the likes of all the user&#39;s photos, but due to the API&#39;s paginated responses, #instakarma only tallies the user&#39;s 20 most recent media. Implementing the complete functionality of the application could be achieved by writing a request loop that iterates through all the user&#39;s media until the last post is reached.</p>
