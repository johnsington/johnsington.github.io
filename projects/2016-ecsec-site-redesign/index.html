<p>Ever since I was young, I had a keen passion for creating. When I was in elementary school, I can vividly recall the countless hours I spent sketching and drawing anything and everything that my imagination conjured. With 2 shades of graphite pencils in my pocket and a cheap Walmart sketchbook, I visually documented the transient sparks of my childhood mind everywhere I went. From sketching neat architecture and drawing fantastic creatures to drafting design plans of cars powered by photosynthesis, sketchbooks were the ideal medium to translate the beautiful insanity of my thoughts as a young kid.</p>
<ul>
<li>finding the bugs</li>
<li>requiring the initialization file</li>
<li>yo the master of the compilation</li>
</ul>
<p>Working in a startup for the first time has greatly challenged my perception of company structure, or more particulary, the absence of one. I was officially casted the role of a full-stack engineer, but I found myself working across multiple departments well beyond writing client-server code for the web. During my internship with them, I found myself wearing multiple hats as a full-stack developer, a QA analyst, and a UI/UX designer. The flexibility of my role with the company given these various roles was great for me to gain experience from a broad set of disciplines. On one hand, I am supporting the full-stack development of their online streaming platform while I find myself designing wireframes for their website redesign the next week. This multidisciplinary role was also great for me to exercise both my skillsets in code and design as I was able to implement the code for the designs I have exclusively conceived. </p>
